  <h3 style="text-align: center">Who am I?</h3>
  <p>I am a graduate from GTCC with an A.A.S in computer programming. I am a
  full time employee by day and an avid developer by night. I have created multiple projects
  using multiple technologies ranging from mobile applications, websites, and games. In my free
  time, I have also begun to be an open source contributor to projects found in GitHub.</p>

<div id="htmlExplained">
  <h4>What have I learned about HTML?</h4>
  <p>The Hyper text markup language is a versatile language. The web markup course has taught me multiple different
    elements that I was unaware of such as div, span,and canvas. In the past, I simply wrote static sites using common
    tags such as p and headers. This class also showed me many layout and styling options using HTML keywords. </p>

</div>

<div id="cssExplained">
  <h4>What has CSS taught me?</h4>

  <p>CSS is more than useful when creating dynamic pages for devices. School has taught me many essential features
    of CSS. My most used method for designing my sites is to use an external style sheet. By using an external style
    sheet, I am allowed the ability to design my pages in one sole file. My web markup and scripting course further
    taught me CSS principles. In the past, I simply defined my element styles individually.</p>

  <p>Now, I am more than comfortable using IDs, classes, and working with nested elements. Using CSS in this site I was
    able to create a box shadow for my HTML body. The element layout within this website has been set up to alter via
    the screen device width to fully encompass multiple screens.</p>
</div>

<div id="jsUsed">
  <h4>How did I use JavaScript on this site?</h4>

  <p>Two of my all-time favorite games are snake, and space invaders. With each new language I learn I make a point to
    try and re-create these games. In the past, I have made snake using Python, Swift, Java, and now JavaScript.
    In school, we were able to learn about key events, accessing elements in the DOM, canvases, and JavaScript syntax.
    To gain further practice, I began the creation of these games. I am still working on space invaders so as of now
    it is omitted. I also decided that I would make a running counter to display how long it has been since my first
    GitHub contribution. This shows around how long I have been developing for!</p>

  <h5>Snake Game</h5>

  <p>For the snake game I decided to go with an embedded JavaScript script. This game, although fun to play, is one of
    the easier games to make. All I needed was a canvas to draw the items, functions to track positions, logic to handle
    collisions, and event listeners for keys. </p>

  <p>Within the script I collect the canvas and initialize variables to contain all necessary elements. The snake, at
    it's simplest, is an array of coordinates within the canvas grid. As the snake eats the apple we cause the snake to
    grow where the head is always at the front of the array. We also access a p tag labeled as score to update with each
    apple consumption. As the snake moves in the grid we draw based on the position and or where the users chose to move
    the head. The game will reset if the snake collides with its self.</p>

  <p>Overall, only four functions were needed to implement this game. This being a smaller game I felt embedded was the
  easier way to go.</p>

  <h5>Contribution clock</h5>

  <p>This clock idea came to me from a previous assignment where we were to create a countdown timer to new years.
  In order to make a counter I needed to create the logic for acquiring the time passed since a set start date and time.
  Once I calculated the correct numbers it was as simple as changing the document element to the correct parameter.</p>
