  <h3 style="text-align: center">Who am I?</h3>
  <p>I am a graduate from GTCC with an A.A.S in computer programming. I am a
    current software developer for Northwestern mutual. I have created multiple projects
    using multiple technologies ranging from mobile applications, websites, and games. In my free
    time, I am a open source contributor to projects found in GitHub.</p>

<div id="htmlExplained">
  <h4>What have I done in programming?</h4>
  <p>Throughout my own self-teaching, and with the help from my academic studies, I practiced with many languages.
    In my experience, I have learned that the language a developer chooses depends on the project they are making.
    I used a multitude of languages to gain practice with web development, mobile applications, database queries, and so
    much more. My most used languages have been Java, Python, Swift, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and PHP. As I am growing in
    my career, I have decided that I will work towards mastery with Java.</p>


  <p>For my Java projects, I have created database driven applications, Spring Boot applications, rest apis,
    Android applications, servlets, and more. My current position has pushed me into creating a multitude of
    microservices allowing the automated provisioning of users for our business needs. Not only has this allowed me
    to dive deeper with Java, but I am also learning CI/CD pipeline skills, AWS cloud concepts, microservices best
    practices, and database design concepts.</p>

  <p>The project that I have kept up with the most is my
    <a class="button" href="https://github.com/GothamsJoker/Npc" target="_blank">NPC Project</a>. This project has
    landed me with over 150,000 downloads and is one of the more popular, free to use plugins, for Minecraft spigot
    servers. This project was first created in 2020 and is now two years in the making!
    I created this using Java, Maven, and the spigot api. I frequently update this project to appease the users
    and fix issues as the Minecraft and spigot libraries update. In a more recent update, I decided to add a metrics viewer
    allowing users and myself to track information about the users using this plugin.
    You can find the current metric stats here:

  <h4>What are my future plans?</h4>

  <p>To continue learning! Since I am now a software engineer my plan is to grow within my current role
  and work towards mastery with application design. Where once I was creating less complex applications, now I am
  developing applications used in a multitude of environments.</p>

  <p>Not only am I learning how to develop these applications but I have also started to perform DevOps and oversee
     the maintaining of our applications. Overall, I am working on learning as much as I can to become a well-rounded
     engineer.</p>
