  <p>I am a graduate from GTCC with an A.A.S in computer programming. I am a
    full time employee by day and an avid developer by night. I have created multiple projects
    using multiple technologies ranging from mobile applications, websites, and games. In my free
    time, I have also begun to be an open source contributor to projects found in GitHub.</p>

<div id="htmlExplained">
  <h4>What have I done in programming?</h4>
  <p>Throughout my own self-teaching and with the help from my academic studies I practiced with many languages.
    In my experience I have learned that the language a developer chooses depends on the project they are making.
    I used a multitude of languages to gain practice with web development, mobile applications, database queries, and so
    much more. My most used languages have been Java, Python, Swift, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and PHP. As I am growing in
    my career, I have decided that I will work towards mastery with Java.
    For my Java projects, I created databases, rest apis, Android applications, servlets, and more.</p>

  <p>The project that I have kept up with the most is my
    <a class="button" href="https://github.com/GothamsJoker/Npc" target="_blank">NPC Project</a>. This project has
    landed me with over 140,000 downloads and is one of the more popular free to use plugin for Minecraft spigot
    servers. This project was first created in 2020 and is now two years in the making!
    I created this using Java, Maven, and the spigot api. I frequently update this project to appease the users
    and fix issues as the Minecraft and spigot libraries update. In a more recent update I decided to add a metrics
    allowing users and myself to track information about the users using this plugin.
    You can find the current metric stats here:

  <h4>How did I use JavaScript on this site?</h4>

  <p>Two of my all-time favorite games are snake, and space invaders. With each new language I learn I make a point to
    try and re-create these games. In the past, I have made snake using Python, Swift, Java, and now JavaScript.
    In school, we were able to learn about key events, accessing elements in the DOM, canvases, and JavaScript syntax.
    To gain further practice, I began the creation of these games. I also decided that I would make a running counter
    to display how long it has been since my first GitHub contribution. This shows around how long I have been
    developing for!</p>

  <h5>Snake Game</h5>

  <p>For the snake game I decided to go with an embedded JavaScript script. This game, although fun to play, is one of
    the easier games to make. All I needed was a canvas to draw the items, functions to track positions, logic to handle
    collisions, and event listeners for keys. </p>

  <p>Within the script I collect the canvas and initialize variables to contain all necessary elements. The snake, at
    it's simplest, is an array of coordinates within the canvas grid. As the snake eats the apple we cause the snake to
    grow where the head is always at the front of the array. We also access a p tag labeled as score to update with each
    apple consumption. As the snake moves in the grid we draw based on the position and or where the users chose to move
    the head. The game will reset if the snake collides with its self.</p>

  <p>Overall, only four functions were needed to implement this game. This being a smaller game I felt embedded was the
    easier way to go.</p>

  <h5>Contribution clock</h5>

  <p>This clock idea came to me from a previous assignment where we were to create a countdown timer to new years.
    In order to make a counter I needed to create the logic for acquiring the time passed since a set start date and
    time.
    Once I calculated the correct numbers it was as simple as changing the document element to the correct
    parameter.</p>
