      <h2>Solved server configuration issues for QuestDB</h2>
      <p>
        QuestDB needed a method to track property keys for server configuration files at start up. Upon taking this
        issue, I realized the current method to load these property keys was using string literals. Over three hundred
        lines had lengthy string literal property keys which can be vulnerable to error. To promote code reusability,
        type safety, and reduce errors I created an enum storing property keys.</p>
        <p>Using my new enum I was able to replace
        the majority of the code within their server configuration driver. I added a test and property key validation
        method. The added method will prevent the server from running if users enter incorrect keys in the server
        configuration file. The method will throw a server configuration exception and display the invalid line.
        Overall, this project was merged with QuestDB with 724 added lines and 321 deleted. This was my biggest
        accepted PR!</p>

        submitted a pull request with my suggested changes. This pull request was accepted and merged into their

      <h2>Created a data structure and algorithm overview repository</h2>
      <p> While in school, in my own free time, I decided to make a learning repository that I could constantly come
        back to. Using the knowledge that I gained from school and, with the aid of Data structures and Algorithms in
        Java, I put together an all-in-one repo. The repo has in-depth readmes and code examples on how to implement
        while also explaining the use cases of widely used data structures and algorithms.</p>

      <h2>Implemented a metric tracking system for NPC</h2>
      <p>To aid me as a developer, I implemented a metric tracking system of users that use my plugin.
        This metric system was heavily needed as users were downloading incorrect version in retrospect to their
        minecraft server version. Using these metrics I was able to identify the versioning issue and also see other
        useful specs in regard to their environments.</p>

      <h2>Enrolled at GTCC</h2>
      <p>Although I was enjoying being a self-taught programmer, I decided getting an education from an accredited
        school would strengthen my knowledge best. GTCC enabled me to learn more programming languages and the
        underlying skills of a well-rounded developer. The A.A.S Computer programming track allowed me to hone my skills
        in data structures, networking sciences, data science, hardware specifications, backend development, and
        frontend development. </p>

      <h2>Created the NPC plugin</h2>
      <p>The NPC plugin is one of the bigger plugins that I made for Minecraft. It solves a simple need and best of all I offered it as free.
      This plugin quickly became one of the most free to download plugins for minecraft spigot servers. With over 150,000 downloads, this project is now
      widely used and one that I come back to frequently to update and add features for the users.</p>

      <p>Creating server side plugins in Minecraft was a great learning experience for me. Since Minecraft is based
      primarily using the Java langauge I was able to put my skill to the test. I spent many nights developing interesting,
      fun, and useful plugins for my local server. </p>

      <p>Starting out I followed the developer guides offered from Oracle. I mainly started out learning

      I enjoyed reading Head first with Java, Concurrency in Java, and Data structures and Algorithms implemented in Java.</p>
